Ajax 

Stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML.

Ajax allows you to update HTML without loading a new WebPage.
When you build a website  Ajax allows you to ask for information from the server.

This is called the Request

The server sends data back to the browser also known as the client and 

This is known as a Response.

Javascript processes that data to selectively change parts of the web page.

The amount of data sent back is usually less than when requesting a whole webpage this speeds things up considerably

We can see this with google maps as we move the location around and with Twitter's infinite scroll where tweets load when needed or submitting a vote on Reddit where you don't leave the current Webpage but your vote is sent to the server.

You can see this happen by viewing dev tools. cmd + alt + i on mac;

Today we won't be going into using Ajax on the server-side (back end) which would require using a server side framework like PHP, PYTHON, RUBY, or "Nodejs" etc...

The technical name for Ajax is the XMLHttpRequest Object
